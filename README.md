## 📌 About the Project

This project was created as part of my capstone practical assessment. The goal was to build a clean, navigable website using basic HTML/CSS/JS — ideal for travel agencies showcasing destination-based tour packages. I chose Paris to create an elegant and engaging layout inspired by real-world platforms.
